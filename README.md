# IBM Cloud Applications with Node.js and React
## Cloud Applications with Node.js and React

Welcome to the Cloud Applications with Node.js and React repository. This project is aimed at demonstrating the development of cloud-based applications using Node.js and React.


## Introduction

In this project, we showcase how to build cloud applications using the Node.js backend and React for the front end. You will find examples, best practices, and templates to get started with your own cloud applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js and npm installed on your development environment.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript, Node.js, and React.
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for coding.

## Getting Started
